## About
A simple 2D adventure game, inspired by the classic "The Legend of Zelda", developed in C with the Raylib graphics library. The goal of the game is to guide the hero through multiple levels, defeating all the monsters.

## Features

* **Character Movement:** Control the hero on a 2D grid-based map, with obstacle collision detection.

* **Multiple Levels:** Dynamic loading of different levels from text files (`level1.txt`, `level2.txt`, etc.).

* **Simple AI Enemies:** Monsters that move randomly around the environment, posing a challenge to the player.

* **Combat System:** Short-range sword attacks to defeat monsters.

* **Life and Scoring System:** The player starts with 3 lives and earns 100 points for each monster defeated.

* **Persistent High Scores:** The top 5 scores are saved in a binary file (`ranking.bin`) and loaded each time the game is played.

* **Interface Screens:** The game has a well-defined screen flow:

  * **Main Menu** with options to start a new game and exit.
  * **Name Entry Screen**, which appears when the player achieves a new record.
  * **Game End Screen** (Victory or Defeat) which displays the final score.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the project, you will need:

* A C compiler, such as GCC.
* The Raylib library configured in your environment.

You must set the correct path to where the Raylib library is installed on your computer. After compiling (`ctrl + shift + B`), an executable named `zinf.exe` will be created.

To run, open a terminal in the project root folder and run the following command:

```bash
.\zinf.exe
```
## Project Structure

The code was organized modularly to facilitate maintenance and understanding, separating responsibilities:

* `main.c`: Entry point and main game loop, responsible for managing the screens.

* `renderer.c`: Module responsible for loading and drawing all the game's textures.

* `player.c` / `monster.c` / `combat.c`: Modules containing the game's main logic (gameplay).

* `level.c`: Responsible for loading maps from text files.

* `scoreboard.c`: Manages reading and writing the high score file.

* `*_screen.c`: Each screen file (such as `menu_screen.c`, `endscreen.c`, `enter_name_screen.c`) manages its own state, logic, and drawing, in an encapsulated manner.

## Gameplay Loop

* In the menu screen, the player can either start a new game or exit, closing the application.

* After starting a new game, the player can control the character with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys and start chasing and killing the monsters, with `J` key to attack with the sword. If the player gets hit 3 times, the character loses all 3 lives and dies, triggering the endgame screen.

* If the player's score is high enough to replace one of the five top scores from the current scoreboard, a screen is called to ask for the player's name.

* The endgame screen contains the current updated scoreboard, a unique message indicating the player's death or win, and the option to play again from the start or to exit the game.
